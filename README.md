Project developed for the study presented in the article “Using a Deep Learning model to detect kidney stones in unenhanced CT images”.
<br><br>
This study proposes a Convolucional Neural Network model for detecting kidney stones in computed tomography images. The model was trained with a dataset composed of images obtained from individuals who underwent examinations to analyze diseases in the urinary system. The model achieved an accuracy rate of 96.20% in its predictions.
