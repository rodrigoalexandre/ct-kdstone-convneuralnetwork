Project developed for the study presented in the article “Employing advanced Deep Learning technology for the detection of kidney stones in unenhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging: a model-based approach” published by International Journal of Technology, Innovation, and Management (Volume 03, Issue 02, Dec. 2023).
<br><br>
This study proposes a Convolucional Neural Network model for detecting kidney stones in computed tomography images. The model was trained with a dataset composed of images obtained from individuals who underwent examinations to analyze diseases in the urinary system. The model achieved an accuracy rate of 96.20% in its predictions.
